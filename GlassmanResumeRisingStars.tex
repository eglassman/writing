\section{Interests} 
Intelligent Tutoring Systems, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), and websites like Khan Academy and Codecademy are now used to teach programming courses at a massive scale. A single programming exercise may produce thousands of solutions from learners. Understanding solution variation is important for providing appropriate feedback to students at scale. The wide variation among these solutions can be a source of pedagogically valuable examples, and can be used to refine the autograder for the exercise by exposing corner cases. I work on systems for visualizing and exploring thousands of programming solutions that help teachers more quickly develop a high-level view of students' understanding and misconceptions, and to provide feedback that is relevant to more students. 
\section{Keywords} 
Human-computer interaction, information visualization, learning sciences, educational technology, machine learning.

%These systems use both static and dynamic analysis to cluster similar solutions, and let instructors further filter and cluster solutions based on different criteria.I design and carry out user studies to test how these systems affect their target users, namely, teachers and students. We Results indicate that the  allows teachers to more quickly develop a high-level view of students' understanding and misconceptions, and to provide feedback that is relevant to more students.
%My current research focuses on improving the assistance available to students working on computer-based engineering challenges. This work involves providing supplemental information to teachers supervising large numbers of engineering solution submissions, facilitating effective peer-pairing, and automating certain types of debugging assistance for students.
%I have a long-standing interest in the process of learning, creation, and discovery, from an early fascination with creating artificial intelligence to my current focus on the role of play, communities of practice, learning styles, historical context, and storytelling in the development of expertise in a given discipline. My intellectual curiousity is fueled by personal experiences at home, as an MIT undergrad and graduate student, and as an athlete.
% learning how to wrestle well in national and international women's freestyle wrestling tournaments. 
%points to go over: learning for wrestling, communities of practice, results from positive psychology, play, different learning styles, The Talent Code, process of learning rather than what I'm learning, process of science, rather than the conclusions (Bill Bryson's book, Tube, etc.), historical context and storytelling as a part of technical teaching, what-if game
%I am always looking for new, exciting ways for the public to interact with, and be assisted by, technology. I have helped produce an early prototype of a cell-phone-centered job marketplace, specified by Assured Labor, a start-up hoping to improve the lives of workers in developing countries using mobile phones. I also was a team member of GlobalHealth, which attempted to leverage epidemiological data to better distribute Pakistan's limited health care resources in real-time. My earlier work includes proposing the use of socially intelligent robots as speech therapy tools for children, and developing a signal processing method specifically for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), which allow the muscularly disabled to control computers with their brainwaves, either measured with scalp electrodes or implanted electrode arrays. Now I work on algorithms for making robots more agile; when visitors swing by my lab space, I often hook my robot up to a playstation controller and let them try to control the robot themselves. 
%The control of dynamical systems is not only fundamentally beautiful and challenging, it requires a deep understanding of the natural and/or man-made system to be controlled. The implementation of that control system can require the integration of signal processing, physical actuation, feature selection, and even reinforcement learning. I want to ultimately become a professor working at the intersection of these fields.
