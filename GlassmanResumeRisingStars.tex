\begin{resume} 
 
\section{Interests} 
I create tools for teaching programming to thousands of students at once. Specifically, I focus on systems for visualizing variation in student solutions to programming problems at scale. I aim to empower teachers with the information they need to assess students' understanding and provide feedback that is relevant to as many students as possible. I also am president of MIT-MEET, which helps teach gifted Israelis and Palestinians computer science and teamwork in Jerusalem.\\
{\it Human-computer interaction (HCI), learning at scale, computer science education.}

%Thousands of students are learning to program in MOOCs and large residential classes, but we still have the same small staff supporting them. I'm creating user interfaces for (1) giving teachers a birdâ€™s eye view of all the programs students generate and (2) helping students help each other. For example, OverCode helps programming teachers get the gestalt of their hundreds (or thousands) of students' solutions.

%My thesis research is inspired by my experiences as part of the teaching staff for 6.004 Computation Structures, an undergraduate lab class focusing on computer architecture. I continue to serve the course as a recitation instructor and Amar Bose Teaching Fellow.

%I am also a Computer Science instructor ('13) and part of the leadership ('13-'15) for the MIT-MEET program. MEET sends MIT students to Jerusalem to teach both gifted Palestinian and Israeli high school students computer science, entrepreneurship, and teamwork so that they are empowered to create positive change.

%I'm a PhD Candidate in Rob Miller's research group. Before joining Rob Miller's group, I completed my M.Eng. in the MIT CSAIL Robot Locomotion Group. I have also published several papers and share a patent in biomedical signal processing, with the mentorship of John Guttag (MIT CSAIL) and Jack Gelfand.
