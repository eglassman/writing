\section{Interests} 
I create tools and user interfaces for teaching and learning online and at scale. I am currently working on tools for teaching programming to thousands of students at once.\\
{\it Human-computer interaction (HCI), learning at scale, computer science education.}

%Thousands of students are learning to program in MOOCs and large residential classes, but we still have the same small staff supporting them. I'm creating user interfaces for (1) giving teachers a birdâ€™s eye view of all the programs students generate and (2) helping students help each other. For example, OverCode helps programming teachers get the gestalt of their hundreds (or thousands) of students' solutions.

%My thesis research is inspired by my experiences as part of the teaching staff for 6.004 Computation Structures, an undergraduate lab class focusing on computer architecture. I continue to serve the course as a recitation instructor and Amar Bose Teaching Fellow.

%I am also a Computer Science instructor ('13) and part of the leadership ('13-'15) for the MIT-MEET program. MEET sends MIT students to Jerusalem to teach both gifted Palestinian and Israeli high school students computer science, entrepreneurship, and teamwork so that they are empowered to create positive change.

%I'm a PhD Candidate in Rob Miller's research group. Before joining Rob Miller's group, I completed my M.Eng. in the MIT CSAIL Robot Locomotion Group. I have also published several papers and share a patent in biomedical signal processing, with the mentorship of John Guttag (MIT CSAIL) and Jack Gelfand.
