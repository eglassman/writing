\begin{resume} 
 
\section{Interests} 
I create tools for teaching programming to thousands of students at once. Specifically, I focus on systems for visualizing variation in student solutions to programming problems at scale. I aim to empower teachers with the information they need to assess students' understanding and provide feedback that is relevant to as many students as possible. I also am President of MIT-MEET, which helps teach gifted Israelis and Palestinians computer science and teamwork in Jerusalem.\\
