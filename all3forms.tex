\def\title{Dealing with Multiple Implementations of Design Problems: Mining Student-Generated Alternatives}
\def\expectedcompletetiondate{May 2015}
\def\briefproblemstatement{
 Visualization and classification of the multiple solutions that students generate in response to assigned engineering design problems will improve hints and answers to students' questions, whether they are provided by peers, staff, or automation. The approach will be to visualize hundreds or thousands of student implementations to discover alternatives, and then classify the path that students take to each implementation, either by machine learning or human staff. The classifications will inform assistance that is given to students, in the form of staff-student discussions, peer-pairing, and automated help.
